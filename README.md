# Toby King Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Description

I have created a portfolio using HTML & CSS. Making use of CSS Flexbox and Grid as well as media queries that make the page responsive so it still looks good on devices with smaller screens. The aim of this is to showcase all of my work and projects from this bootcamp as well as any other projects I do outside of the course. 

The webpage has been made to look like the example portfolio we were given at the start of the assignment. I have added a picture of myself in the About section, a link to the first week's Challenge in the Portfolio section and a link to my GitHub Page. 

This has been a really interesting assignment and has been fun experimenting with CSS Flexbox and Grid. I also had fun trying out different pieces of pseudo code, notably the :hover which I used on the portfolio grids so that when the users cursor hovers over each grid, they glow slightly. This is a neat little UX feature that tells the user that they are clickable links. My knowledge of CSS has greatly improved, especially the CSS box model. 

The website has been uploaded to Github pages. Please find the link in the Instillation section of the README.md.
